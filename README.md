### Hello, this is my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dickson Souza and I am a metallurgical engineer! Coding and software development, however, is on my life for a long time!

It all started as curiosity and it is gradually becoming something more serious along the years, including more recently cloud software development, several learning experiences on C# and Javascript languages, some on the go - learning with codes written by colleagues and partners - and lots of learning listening and reading what technology community produces.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on private sourced software that deals with **thermodynamics** and **mass balance of metallurgical systems**. This is my source of ideas to learn new things, some of them here, in public.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning n**ew concepts of C# / .NET programming** every week or best ways to do old things and also trying to push my knowledge of **Python programming language**, shell languages (mainly Bash, some cmd in Windows and a little bit of PowerShell from time to time)
