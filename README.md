### Hello, this is my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dickson Souza and I am a metallurgical engineer! Coding and software development, however, is on my life for a long time!

It all started as curiosity and it is gradually becoming something more serious along the years, including more recently cloud software development, several learning experiences on C# and Javascript languages, some on the go - learning with codes written by colleagues and partners - and lots of learning listening and reading what technology community produces.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on private sourced software that deals with **thermodynamics** and **mass balance of metallurgical systems**. This is my source of ideas to learn new things, some of them here, in public.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning n**ew concepts of C# / .NET programming** every week or best ways to do old things and also trying to push my knowledge of **Python programming language**, shell languages (mainly Bash, some cmd in Windows and a little bit of PowerShell from time to time).

In my account here, you might see a bunch of small repos created to do experiments, proof-of-concepts or follow allong courses that I'm taking, a lot of forked repos that I have close interest or that I'm currently using in my activities as developer. As of today, January 28th, 2024, there is no flagship project that I'm working on in open source arena although that may change in the future.
