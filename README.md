### Hello, this is my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dickson Souza and I am a metallurgical engineer! Coding and software development, however, is on my life for a long time!

It all started as curiosity and it is gradually becoming something more serious along the years, including more recently cloud software development, several learning experiences on C# and Javascript languages, some on the go - learning with codes written by colleagues and partners - and lots of learning listening and reading what technology community produces.
